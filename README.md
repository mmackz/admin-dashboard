### About the project

Admin Dashboard is the second project for the FullStack JavaScript module on The Odin Project. 
This mock admin dashboard was built as a way to showcase the CSS grid knowledge that have been taught so far in the course. 
The webpage is fully responsive, becoming a single column of content for mobile viewing.
